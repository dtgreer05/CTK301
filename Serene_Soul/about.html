<p class="growingup">Growing up, I didn't have the childhood most would anticipate. In fact, it was a nightmare. But within that nightmare, I had a dream. Due to having no technology, I would often get creative and sing my favorite songs that I heard over the radio to myself on my way to sleep. As sad as that sounds, I've found an escape through music. An entirely new reality. And as a music producer and artist, I aim to create a new reality. But, instead of finding inspiration in trauma, I find inspiration through all things optimistic, exciting, and cathartic. </p>
