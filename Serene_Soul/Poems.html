	<h2>This Was The Beginning</h2>
	<p class="ACry">This is a cry for help. A cry to understand why, we've felt. The burning sensations of their cries for our wealth. Terrified of what the future has to hold. Laying in a place so dark. It is too hard to breathe or cry or eat. Rich and immune of our wrongfull sins We uphold theirs. As they continue to dimish our own self worth. Tossing and turning we mind: Why exactly can't I prosper? I am African-American. Does half of my ethnicity not grant me the American Dream? One half of me hidden and buried and drowned along with the rest of my people who have escaped with grace. The other half yearns to be accepted in a world that yearns to be rid of it. Of me. So what do I do> Told to create my own My own what? Sanctuary Wealth Life. What does it mean to be told that I belong in the fields when I can't walk far enough without being killed. How my forefathers look down on me in disdain because I seek the appeal of the white man's gaze in order to create a better life for me whose mother lived a life of hardship and dysfunction as she spends her life slaving away at the fields with tree branches stretched across her back bearing a strange fruit. For my children Only to be born and treated as a disease that plagues the mind of those not like me with ideas of equalistic propaganda And for you To tell me that I'm not black enough or that I'm too black Or that I should talk proper as you say it in my slang Or that I'm worthless That I should go back where I came from Where you took me from. For you. To slaughter my family before my eyes. To watch my community burn to ashes and ashes and ashes. For You. To hear my pain. My Cry. For Help. </p>

	<H2>and yet, you're heart is calm.</H2>
	<p class="Reassure">I think that's the reason even when we dont see it, we're still calm and reassured. Or at least we should be, that the sun and moon are still there. Only because we still see the hues of its presence in the clouds. That only by the cool waves or the hot breeze. You know they still exist, that they are real...The Sun and the Moon.</p>

	<h2>I wonder</h2>
	<p class="SnM">The wonders of the world make me think. that She's the center of the universe. and i'm the desolate moon spinning around her. What makes me so special> Do the other planets dull my love for her fire? I guess not. For the moon is opposite of sun and yet need each other the most. </p>
